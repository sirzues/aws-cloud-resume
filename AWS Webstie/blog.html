								<p><strong>Overview of the Cloud Resume Challenge:</strong> <i>The Cloud Resume Challenge is a project designed to offer hands-on experience with cloud services, specifically Amazon Web Services (AWS), and web development technologies. Participants are tasked with hosting their resume on a website, utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. This project not only demonstrates technical proficiency but also integrates various AWS services to deploy a fully functional website.</i></p>
								
								<p><strong>Key Components and Their Integration:</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Website Development:</strong> <i>The foundation of the project is the website, crafted using HTML and CSS for structure and styling, respectively. JavaScript is employed to add interactivity, such as dynamically displaying a visitor count. Python, though primarily used in backend processes, plays a crucial role in handling data manipulation and serverless computing tasks.</i></p>
								
								<p><strong>AWS S3 Bucket Configuration:</strong> <i>An S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket on AWS serves as the hosting platform for the website. This choice offers scalability, reliability, and accessibility, making it an ideal solution for static website hosting.</i></p>
								
								<p><strong>Security with CloudFront:</strong> <i>To secure data in transit and enhance website delivery, AWS CloudFront is utilized. This content delivery network (CDN) ensures that communication between the user and the website is encrypted using HTTPS. CloudFront also optimizes content delivery by caching content closer to the user, improving load times and performance.</i></p>
								
								<p><strong>Visitor Count Tracking with DynamoDB and Lambda:</strong> <i>A DynamoDB table records the website's view count, demonstrating AWS's NoSQL database capabilities for fast and scalable data management. A Python-based AWS Lambda function triggers upon each website visit, incrementing the view count in the DynamoDB table. This serverless architecture allows for efficient resource use and scalability.</i></p>
								
								<p><strong>CI/CD Pipeline:</strong> <i>Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) are achieved through a pipeline that automates code updates from the desktop to the S3 bucket. Using YAML scripts for pipeline configuration, this setup ensures that any changes committed to the GitHub repository are automatically deployed to AWS, keeping the website up-to-date.</i></p>
								
								<p><strong>Integration with Google Sheets via App Scripts:</strong> <i>To overcome limitations in data collection from website forms, Google Sheets is integrated using Apps Script. This allows for seamless data transfer from website submissions to a spreadsheet, facilitating feedback collection and data analysis without manual intervention.</i></p>
								
								<p><strong>How It Works:</strong> <i>When a user visits the website through the CloudFront URL, the S3-hosted website files are served, displaying the resume.
								JavaScript on the webpage communicates with the AWS Lambda function to fetch and update the view count stored in DynamoDB, showcasing real-time visitor engagement.
								HTML and CSS define the content and presentation of the website, while the contact form, initially limited by Google Forms, now efficiently sends submissions to Google Sheets via Apps Script.
								The CI/CD pipeline ensures any changes made to the website's codebase are automatically propagated to the S3 bucket, with CloudFront caching considerations managed through invalidation for immediate content updates.</i></p>
								
								<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> <i>Completing this project provided me with a practical application of cloud computing and web development technologies, showcasing a seamless integration of AWS services, programming languages, and third-party tools. By navigating the complexities of deploying a secure, dynamic website, I've gained invaluable experience in cloud infrastructure, serverless computing, and automated deployment processes, preparing them for future challenges in the tech industry. I am looking forward to exploring Lambda more to process images into a desired resolution. I will keep you all updated.</i></p>
